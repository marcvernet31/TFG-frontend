The front-end because of it being a React app, itâ€™s fully contained and needs very  
little configuration.  The only requirement is to have installed the Node Package  
Manager (npm) for Javascript. Assuming that npm is installed, the front-end  
files can be installed with: 
```
> git clone https://github.com/marcvernet31/TFG-frontend.git  
>  cd TFG-frontend
>  npm install  
```
And the program can be executed with:  
```
> npm start
```  
By default, the frontend is hosted on the  localhost:3000, and it assumes that the  
back-end is hosted on  localhost:8000. The base url for the back-end is hardcoded  
in many places in the front-end, and it should be changed if the back-end is not  
running on the same local machine.
